# Cloud Setup (AWS EC2)

This document describes how the conversational-interface backend and frontend is deployed on AWS EC2 using the Free Tier.

A single EC2 instance is used to host:
- Python (Flask) backend
- Node.js (Express) 
- Frontend

 Backend and the frontend run on a different port.

## Overview

- Cloud Provider: AWS EC2
- OS: Amazon Linux
- Instance Type: Free Tier eligible

## Network Configuration (Security Groups)

The following inbound rules are enabled on the EC2 Security Group:

| Port | Service              | Purpose       |
|-----:|----------------------|-------------  |
| 5000 | Python Flask Backend | `/chat` API   |
| 8000 | Node.js Frontend     | `/chat` API   |
| 22   |  SSH                 |Remote Terminal|
|3000  |Frontend              |  UI Access    |

### Project Setup
In EC2->Instance, click on Connect and select public link.
In the opened EC2 terminal :-
```
git clone https://github.com/prasenjitb-cloud/conversational-interface.git

cd conversational-interface
```


### Deployment (Python Backend)

Run these commands :-
```
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install python3 -y
sudo yum install python3-pip -y
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

## Run the Flask app

```
cd backend
cd python-server
python3 app.py
```
## Run using nohup to keep the process alive after logout
```
nohup python3 app.py > flask.log 2>&1 &
```

The Flask backend is deployed on AWS EC2 (Free Tier).

- Cloud Provider: AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux)
- Public IP: 16.16.207.21
- Port: 5000

## Live Test URL
GET:
http://16.16.207.21:5000/chat?message=hello

This url is used to test Flask Backend API.

This endpoint is accessible from both desktop and mobile browsers.

### Notes
- Port 5000 is enabled via EC2 Security Group inbound rules.
- Flask is currently running using the built-in development server.


## AWS Setup Steps
1. Created an EC2 instance (Free Tier)
2. Enabled inbound rule for port 5000
3. Installed Python and Flask
4. Ran the Flask app using `python3 app.py`

## Deployment (Node)

To Install Node Run:-
```
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash -
sudo yum install nodejs -y
```

Install Dependencies:-
```
cd frontend
cd node
npm install
```

To Run:-
``` 
npm run start
``` 
or 
``` 
node server.js
```

The Node.js Server is deployed on AWS EC2 (Free Tier).

- Cloud Provider: AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux)
- Public IP: 16.16.207.21:8000
- Port: 8000

### Live Test URL
GET:
http://16.16.207.21:8000/chat?message=hello

This url is used to test Node.

This endpoint is accessible from both desktop and mobile browsers.


### Notes 
Port 8000 is enabled via EC2 Security Group inbound rules.

Express is currently running as the primary server for the frontend UI and Node API.

### Deployment(Frontend)
In the frontend folder
Initialize npm(Creates package.json)
```
npm init -y
```
Install a Node based Server
```
npm install http-server
```
Inside package.json change:-
```
"scripts": {
  "start": "http-server -p 3000"
}
```

On the EC2 instance,click on Connect and:-
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start &
```
### Live Test URL
GET:
http://16.16.207.21:3000

This url is used to test the frontend.




## Note 
 If the instance is stopped and started, the Public IP will change.
 Ensure the Frontend code is updated with the new IPv4 address.
