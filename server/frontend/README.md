## Frontend 

A minimal web-based UI is included to interact with the `/chat` API.

- Users can enter a message and send it to the backend
- The conversation history is displayed on the screen
- The UI communicates with the backend using HTTP POST requests

To use the UI:
1. Start the backend server (`node server.js`)
or Start the backend server(Python) (`flask run`)
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
